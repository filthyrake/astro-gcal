# astro-gcal
The Goal:

I got tired of constantly keeping an Astrospheric tab open and checking it all the time to figure out when I might be able to have a night of astrophotography.  So I had the idea of writing a tool to automatically create/delete/update events on my google calendar (based on the metrics I define for acceptable weather) whenever the forecast is right.

This is intended to be run out of AWS, using a series of Lambdas and DynamoDB.  This requires a Pro Astrospheric account in order to get an Astrospheric API key.


Current Status: Broken, I think.  A major refactoring and simplification is underway right now.
